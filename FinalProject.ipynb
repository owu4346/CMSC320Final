    "# An Analysis and Breakdown of League of Legends Matches\n",
    "By Oliver Wu\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "League of Legends (LoL) is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. It is one of the most popular computer games in the world, and especially so in Asia. The core idea of the game is relatively simple. The map is a square divided in half diagonally into two sides by a \"river\", representing the two teams, each containing five players. There are three \"lanes\" and a \"jungle\" inbetween the lanes representing a a free roam area. Each lane has three towers pre team, and in the center of a teams base, they have two towers defending their \"nexus\". The first team to destroy the other team's nexus first wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the core idea of the game is simple, the games themselves are incredibly complex. There are over 150+ characters, or champions to chose in the game, along with dozens of different items to chose. There are so many different ways to customize the combinations of champions items, and spells, runes, and numerous other factors that there is no one way to win the game. A big part of the reason for why I've been playing this game for almost 7 years now is that the game is constantly updated with new features, which helps to make each and every match feel unique and different from the last.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset I chose to use is a list of over 50,000 ranked matches collected on the European West server using the official Riot Games API service. The data was collected on patch 7.17.2. For reference, the first number of a patch always represents the current season, meaning that this data was collected in season 7. The game is currently on season 12, meaning this data is about 5 years old. The dataset can be reached [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/league-of-legends)\n",
    "\n",
    "This goal of this tutorial is to narrow down this extremely large amount of data into smaller more bite sized chunks that can be analyzed in different parts. There are so many different ways to approach the data given, such as analyzing which team tends to win after getting first baron buff, or which color side wins, or even which champions tend to win more. I want to analyze the different data we have and see if we are able to predict a win in League of Legends using the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: There a quite a few terms that are used interchangablely with this game, in this section I will keep a list of these terms for the sake of consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "League of Legends = LoL\n",
    "\n",
    "Characters = Champions\n",
    "\n",
    "Game = Match*\n",
    "\n",
    "*_I'm electing to use the term match to describe one individual play session as game can represent both the video game itself and the play session_\n",

    "As you can probably see, we didn't really narrow the data down that much, a measly two columns were dropped, still leaving us with 59 columns. One approach to further tidying the data would be to combine some of the columns. However, I want to avoid that approach as a lot of the data in the dataset is represented by ID's which could create a lot more complexity that I would like to avoid. Another idea is to divide this dataset into three smaller datasets. The first dataset is going to be titled **draft**, representing all of the factors set during the initial draft phase of the game (champions, summoner spells, bans). The second dataset is going to titled **objectives**, representing tasks completed in the game (first blood, first tower, first inhibitor, first baron, first dragon, first rift herald, tower kills, inhibitor kills, baron kills, dragon kills, rift herald kills)"

    "Adding in the other objectives gave us a lot more data to look at. Before we actually analyze the data, I want to give some quick context on what parts of the games these objectives tend to happen. A LoL game is typically divided into three sections, the Early Game, the Mid Game, and the Late Game. These are exactly as they sound and represents different time points in the game. While there are no exact values for what consititutes each section of the game, some extremely approximate values to use for reference are the following: Early game 0-15 Minutes, Mid Game 16-30 minutes, Late Game 31+ Minutes into the game. First Blood almost always occurs early into the game. First Tower tends to occur at the end of early game and going into mid game. First Inhibitor in the middle of mid game, first baron later in mid game, first dragon in the middle of early game, and first herald in the middle of early game. The later in the game a objective is taken, the more importance it has towards winning a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately we can see that the team that gets the first Rift Herald of the game has a very low win rate at 34.14%. On the other hand, the team that gets the first Inhibitor Tower has a 80% win rate. First Blood tends to almost always be the first objective that occurs in a game of LoL. I believe thats why it should be used as a frame of reference. As we discussed before, First Blood resulted in a 58.47% win rate. Surprisingly, even though First Blood occurs so early in the game, it still results in a higher win rate than an objective like Baron which is one of the most major objectives in the game, which only results in a 48.94% win rate. First Dargon, another very early objective is boasts a honestly astonishing 65.39% win rate. First tower, another early objective also boasts a higher win rate than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, theres a lot of variation on the results. Mid-Late game objectives don't necessarily result in wins, and Early game objectives can highly contribute to a higher win rate as well. This is exactly what I wanted to discuss about LoL! Win rates are not determined by linear factors.\n",

    "# Exploring other routes\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this path is pretty limited, and theres not much more we can explore with solely objectives. Looking at all of the other data available, basing wins off of summoner spells is trivial, as one summoner spell is almost always the same for every player on the team. Number of objectives could be a worthwhile path to approach, however, faces a problem of certain factors not tracked by our dataset. For example, with something like Baron kills, we do not know how many subsequent towers were taken by that team after that Baron was slain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its clear that our objectives dataset is likely not going to get us any further with our hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about our draft dataset?\n",
    "Bans is another one of those stats that requires extra information to know its relevancy in our win that its not worth pursuing in this case. However, champion picks has incredible potential for both determining a win, and predicting a win.\n",

    "As we can see from our bar graph, most of the champions hover around a 50% winrate, which signals that overall most champions in the game are in a mostly equalized state. Not too strong, and not too weak. However, there are some outliers, such as Quinn, Ryze, and Azir who are doing especially poorly, hovering around close to a 40% winrate. These champions as such are likely slated for positive changes, or buffs in a near-future patch as they are considered struggling. Other champions such as Jarvan IV, Renekton, and Yorick are hovering closer to a 60% win rate. These champions opposite to the three mentioned earlier, are likely slated for negative changes, or nerfs in a near-future patch as they are considered too strong. Riot games uses winrates heavily as a metric for determining whether or not a champion needs to be changed between different patches (updates) to the game. As such, winrates will very tend heavily from patch to patch. As such, I want to clarify that this information, and subsequent prediction are only valid for patch 7.17.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Now we have the winrates of every champion, but how can we expand on this data? We pretty much eliminated every other column data available...except for one forgotten one. Game duration. Game duration is a perfect piece of data to compare with champion win rates, as many champions are stronger at different points in the game. So lets refine our question. Given a champion, and a game duration, can we predict the win"

    "What happened? Why is there a bunch of missing values, infinitys, and divide by zero errors? Well, unforunately, this is a the end of the line of this hypothesis. The way this data is setup is that for each champion we have an associated winrate value. However, this provides no training data for the linear regression model to work on. Okay, but what if we just inputed all of the champions in and used the winner column to see which champion combinations win. This could theoretically work, but is held back by the binary nature of the winner column, leading to the necessary usage of a more complex logistical regression model, which even then wouldn't exactly give us the results we desired. The other main problem is that not every champion appears in every game, so a lot of the data ends up not working for a lot of the champions. One solution would be to focus on one specific champion, but that again would limit our possible data. As such, its time to rethink and switch to a different hypothesis.\n",

    "You're probably wondered why I wasted so much time going through this hypothesis just to show in the end why we couldn't make a model of it. The point of this was mainly to show why certain models don't work as they might seem and that a lot of thinking and adaption to a dataset is what is necessary to get results for a hypothesis on a dataset\n",

    "Not all is lost here. First, I want to think about what exactly made the last hypothesis not work for our model. It was the binary nature of the \"winner\" column. Due to it only having two states, it made it hard to make a worthwhile and working model of it. As such, a solution would be to find a more quantitative data value. Looking through all of the columns, theres an obvious answer that's been missed: Game Duration. Game Duration is a great value to work with as its quantitative, and every single game has a game duration. Furthermore, its something interesting to think about as few people think about how champions affect match duration. So for our new hypothesis, lets ask, whether the champions and champion combinations in a match of LoL affect the duration of a game?"

    "You're probably asking why I chose this dataset despite not getting any significantly successful results? The answer is once again that I love how complex this game is, and how data science is not simply linear. There are so many different ways to look and analyze data, and sometimes the datasets you have might not work for certain types of analysis, while they accel at others. Sometimes the data shows exactly the coorelations you want, and sometimes it doesn't. This dataset shows that even though it had over 60 columns and 50,000 rows of data, we were still missing some parts that could potentially have resulted in a different hypothesis and a different conclusion. I urge you to try playing League of Legends yourself as well! While the game is not beginner friendly by any means, once you get past the early learning curve of the game, the strategy behind it becomes a great deal of fun! "
